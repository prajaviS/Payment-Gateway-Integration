# Payment Gateway Integration using Razorpay API
This project demonstrates the integration of a payment gateway using Razorpay API and creating a charity website for donation using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The website is designed to be responsive, meaning it can adapt to various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

The website has a simple and user-friendly design that allows users to make donations securely. The payment gateway integration is done using Razorpay API, which ensures that transactions are processed smoothly and securely. The website also includes a form that allows users to enter their donation amount and other details.

The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a visually appealing website that is easy to navigate. Bootstrap provides a set of pre-designed components and styles that help to streamline the development process and ensure consistency across the website.

The project also includes a razorpay.php file that handles the backend processing of payments. This file communicates with the Razorpay API to initiate transactions and ensure that they are completed successfully.

Overall, this project showcases the use of various tools and technologies to create a functional and visually appealing charity website with a payment gateway integration. It demonstrates the importance of secure payment processing and responsive design in modern web development.
